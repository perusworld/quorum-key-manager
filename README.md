# Quorum Key Manager
Quorum Key Manager (QKM) is a key management service developed under the [BSL 1.1](LICENSE) license and written in Go. 

Quorum Key Manager exposes an HTTP API service to manage your secrets, keys and Ethereum accounts. QKM supports the integration with
*AWS Key Management Service*, *Azure Key Vault* and *HashiCorp Vault*. 

In addition, using the JSON-RPC interface of the QKM, you can connect to your Ethereum nodes to sign your transaction using the Ethereum account stored in your secure key vault.
